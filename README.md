Compiling on Windows:
Compiled using MSVS 2015. 
You'll need to set up OpenGL, GLEW, and trimesh.lib in the settings of the solution as required libraries.

Compiling on Linux:
In the file EnvSpec.h: You'll need to switch the comment from Defining Windows to Defining Linux.
The included Makefile should generate a run file that will launch the program.

'Left' - Move NurbsMan backwards along the curve
'Right' - Move NurbsMan forward along the curve

Code Re-use:
Majority of Code was written by me with some small functions provided by previous instructors for Image Reading. Code was repurposed from my Animation/Rendering Framework to use a 2D/Orothogonal View Camera to view 3D images on a 2D plane.
